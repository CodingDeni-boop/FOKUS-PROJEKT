# FOKUS-PROJEKT

This is a PYTHON file that runs on Python 3.13 and will only run in an environment with said versions and libraries. 
Here are useful environment creation lines for terminal with conda

Python 3.13:
conda create --name fokus python=3.13
conda activate fokus

libraries: (I am using all the latest versions, but clarity is best to avoid library conflicts)
conda install "library"="version"
